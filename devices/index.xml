Needed configuration By default, all Asus lights that are not a keyboard will default to the mouse logo color. To change this behaviour, you must open the Aurora settings, get to the &amp;ldquo;Devices and Wrappers&amp;rdquo; tab and click the &amp;ldquo;Configure Asus Peripheral Devices&amp;rdquo; button, which will open an interface to assign each individual light to a certain key or zone, such as mousepad lights.</description></item><item><title>Corsair</title><link>//aurora-rgb.github.io/Docs/devices/corsair/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//aurora-rgb.github.io/Docs/devices/corsair/</guid><description>Required Software Corsair iCUE Needed configuration The SDK should come enabled by default when you install iCUE, but in case it doesn&amp;rsquo;t connect, make sure it is enabled.
Known Issues Disabling the desktop profile should cause devices to fallback to their default configuration, however this is bugged for corsair devices specifically, causing them to turn black instead. This bug needs a rework of the aurora implementation to be fixed.</description></item><item><title>Logitech</title><link>//aurora-rgb.github.io/Docs/devices/logitech/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//aurora-rgb.github.io/Docs/devices/logitech/</guid><description>Required Software One of:

If you still cannot control your keyboard or mouse illumination, check if Color Special Event is enabled in Aurora applet in SSE.
Known Issues Devices with number of zones other than 1, 2 or 12 are not fully supported (ex. Rival 600) - they may still work but not all zones can be controlled.</description></item><item><title>Wooting</title><link>//aurora-rgb.github.io/Docs/devices/wooting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//aurora-rgb.github.io/Docs/devices/wooting/</guid><description>Required Software None. Aurora will connect directly to your keyboard
Needed configuration None. Connection should be automatic. If Aurora fails to connect at first, replug the keyboard and start Aurora again.
Known issues Aurora overrides any lighting profiles on the keyboard. Due to this, it becomes impossible to tell which profile (digital, analog 1-3) is active at any time. There is currently no fix / workaround for this, but this data might be a game state variable in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
