![Diagram showing Aurora & LightFX integration](img/diagrams/lfx_diagram.png)

You can use Lightsync integration with [all supported devices]({{< relref "/devices/alldevices.md" >}}) using Aurora

You must install LightFX wrapper dll to the game directory from Aurora settings.

> Note that this is reverse engineered and may not work as the original.

In case game integration doesn't work,
use [LightFX Sample Application](https://www.logitechg.com/sdk/LED_SDK_9.00.zip)
to test if the integration is working properly.
