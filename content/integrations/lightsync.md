You can use Lightsync integration with [all supported devices]({{< relref "/devices/alldevices.md" >}})

> Note that this is reverse engineered and may not work as the original.

You can have LGS installed and Aurora will automatically apply game effects to your devices.

LGS must be fully closed before Aurora is launched.
