You can have brand specific integrations (like LightFX and Lightsync) with Razer devices using Aurora.

# Required Software

One of:
* Synapse
* OpenRGB

# Tips

- After installing Synapse, you can disable all Razer services and only leave "Razer Chroma SDK Service" running to reduce background usage.
- Using Chroma SDK Service and a Chroma integrated game make Razer devices flicker. In this case using OpenRGB and "Disabling Device Control" in "Devices & Wrappers" menu of Aurora is recommended


# Needed configuration

The SDK should come enabled by default when you install Synapse.

# Supported Devices

All devices except really recent devices should work. For really recent devices, small update to the SDK library is needed.
