You can use Aurora to change your controller's color depending on games and other variables.

# Required Software

* OpenRGB (for DualSense)

# Needed configuration

DualShock 4 or DualSense should be enabled in OpenRGB. Remapping controller led to correct led may be needed.

# Known issues

PlayStation specific features like Vibration, Haptic and Adaptive Triggers won't work while your color is being updated.
Color updating is recommended to be disabled with supported games by setting a static color to it from Aurora.
