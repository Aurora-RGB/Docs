# Required Software

None. Aurora will connect directly to your keyboard

# Needed configuration

None. Connection should be automatic. If Aurora fails to connect at first, replug the keyboard and start Aurora again.

# Known issues

Aurora overrides any lighting profiles on the keyboard. Due to this, it becomes impossible to tell which profile (digital, analog 1-3) is active at any time.
There is currently no fix / workaround for this, but this data might be a game state variable in the future.

Sometimes having Aurora and Wootility open at the same time can cause the keyboard to stop sending inputs. Replug the keyboard to fix this.
