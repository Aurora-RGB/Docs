# Required Software

* Corsair iCUE

# Needed configuration

The SDK should come enabled by default when you install iCUE, but in case it doesn't connect, make sure it is enabled.

# Supported Devices

Most devices supported by the CUE sdk should work. These devices are listed on Corsair's wiki page [here](https://corsairofficial.github.io/cue-sdk/#supported-devices). Notable exceptions are zone based keyboards like the k55.
