The image layer takes an image saved on your computer and attempts to replicate it on the keyboard by averaging the nearby color at different points. Obviously one should not expect to get the same fidelity you would get with a high-res image, but some images can provide nice effects. In addition, Aurora supports the use of animated GIF images.
