This layer is very similar to the regular particle layer, however instead of constantly spawning particle it does so for each pressed key. If set to region mode, the region will automatically be changed to be the keys that are pressed which allows for effects emanating from where you press.

## Properties
See [particle layer properties]({{% relref "particle#Properties" %}}).
