The Solid Color Layer is for setting static colors for specific keys. The keys will constantly be lit in the given color (providing they arenâ€™t overridden by a higher-up layer). This is one of the most simple layers in Aurora, but can be useful for things such as highlighting controls such as WASD in video games.

If you want to set the color of the entire (or most) of the keyboard, consider using the [Solid Fill Color]({{% ref "reference-layers/solid-fill-color" %}}) Layer instead.
