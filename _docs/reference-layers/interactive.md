The interactive layer listens for key presses on the keyboard and plays an animation from that key. This can be used to make ripple effects (as shown in the GIF below) or have the key light up and slowly fade out when itâ€™s been pressed.

      <td><ul>
        <li><strong>Key Wave</strong> - A circle emerges from the pressed key and slowly expands. It is initially <em>Primary Color</em>, then fades to <em>Secondary Color</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Fade</strong> - The pressed key turns the into the <em>Primary Color</em> then fades to <em>Secondary Color</em> then fades out.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Wave (Filled)</strong> - The same as "Key Wave" but is a filled circle rather than only a border.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrow Flow</strong> - A rectangle with a constant height is created at the location of the pressed key and it slowly increases in width.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Wave (Rainbow)</strong> - Same as "Key Wave" but the circle takes on a gradient color, with blue in the inner side and red on the outer side.</li>
