To edit this animation, the Animation Editor used. This is a powerful tool, and fairly easy to use once you understand how it works. As with all unfamiliar things however, it may be daunting at first.\\nConcepts and Definitions Before getting into the guide itself, let me define some of the concepts and features that are required to fully understand how the animations work.\\n Each frame, the animation is drawn onto a Canvas which is then sent to your connected peripherals. The canvas is a rectangle with a height and a width, this size of which depend on the position and size of the peripherals. Anything drawn to the canvas will be drawn at a specific point on the canvas, with x=0, y=0 being the coordinate of the top left. An animation is built up of one or more Animation Tracks. Each of these tracks can represent a single shape (e.g. rectangle, filled circle, etc.) Each shape has a number of Properties, depending on what sort of shape they are. For example, a circle has radius, center x, center y, color and width properties. These properties determine how the shape will be rendered to the canvas. Each animation track will have one or more Keyframes which are points on the timeline where you can set the properties of a shape. The keyframes do not have to line up on each track. For example one track may only have one keyframe while another may have ten. Between keyframes, the properties of a shape on a track will interpolate, forming a smooth transition.  The Editor With that out of the way, lets move on to the creation of an animation. To open the animation editor, first add an animation layer to your profile. On the layer settings, click on the \\u0026ldquo;Edit Animation\\u0026rdquo; button. When you first open the animation editor you will be presented with a screen that looks like this:\\nThere are 3 main areas to the editor:\\n The timeline which shows the tracks that currently make up the animation as well as also containing a seek line (the vertical red line) which dictates which how far through the animation the preview is. The preview area which shows a skeleton of your peripheral setup and the various shapes that make up the animation at the given time. The property editor which, when a keypoint is selected, allows for editing the properties of that shape for that keypoint.  Creating an Animation First we need to add a track by clicking on the \\u0026ldquo;Add Track\\u0026rdquo; button just above and to the left of the timeline, then choosing the type of shape we wish to add. The manual color track allows you to set individual colors of the keyboard (see Closing Notes), rather than using shapes; the other tracks should be self-explanatory. For the purpose of the tutorial, I will add an (unfilled) circle track.\\nYou should now see a new row has appeared in the timeline. This is the new shape we’ve just created. The left-most grey box shows the name of the track, a delete button and an icon to indicate the type of the track. If you so desire you can double click on the name of the track to change it to something more helpful, though this has no effect on the actual animation itself.\\nNext to the grey box you will see a pair of colored rectangles. These represent a keyframe on the track, the color being indicative of the color of the shape at that keyframe. Clicking this keyframe, we can edit the properties of the circle using the properties in the top right. I\\u0026rsquo;m going to set them to the values in the image below.\\nNext, we\\u0026rsquo;ll need another keyframe to animate to, otherwise we will just have a static image! Double click on the timeline inline with the track to insert a new keyframe at that time. Unfortunately the properties are all reset so we have to enter them again from scratch. Like before though, single left click on the keyframe and set the properties in the properties panel. This time, I will use these settings:\\nYou can add as many other keyframes as you like and even add new tracks with their own keyframes using the steps from above, but I won\\u0026rsquo;t bother.\\nOnce done, you can close the animation editor window. Finally, to ensure the animation plays smoothly, we need to set the Animation Duration property of the Animation Layer to be the length of the animation you just created. If you set a value too small, your animation will appear to be cut off, but too long and you animation will not replay quickly.\\nCongratulations, you\\u0026rsquo;ve made your first animation! :tada:\\n\",\"link\":\"//wibble199.github.io/Aurora-Docs/advanced-topics/animation-editor/\",\"title\":\"Animation Editor\"},{\"content\":\"The animation layer is another very powerful but very complex and hard-to-use layer. It allows for you to create custom animations using shapes and by creating key-frames in the animation editor. There is a basic guide on how to create animations here.\\nThis layer can also be triggered when certain events happen. You can select it for when a game-state value changes or when you press/release a key. When in a key-mode, the animation can optionally be translated to the location of the pressed key. This basically provides a means of creating a custom interactive layer if you don’t like that layer’s default effects.\\nProperties    Name Description     Display Only on Key Sequence Keys If this is selected, the animation will only be displayed on the keys in the Affect Keys list.   Scale to Key Sequence bounds If this is checked, the animation bitmap will be scaled and translated so that it covers the keys in the Affected Keys list.   Affected Keys If Display Only on Key Sequence Keys is checked, the animation will only be displayed on these keys.   Animation Duration The length of time an animation takes to play. If you do not set this value high enough, the animation will appear to be cut off as it ends too early.   Repeat Times The amount of times the animation will repeat. If set to 0, it will repeat indefinitely. When the trigger is not \\u0026ldquo;Always on\\u0026rdquo;, this should not be set to 0 as once triggered the animation will carry on forever.   Trigger This option is how you set when the animations should be played. The sub-properties for each of these trigger modes are detailed in the tabs below. \\u0026ldquo;Always On\\u0026rdquo; does not have any additional properties.

Trigger keys The keys that should trigger an animation. Not needed if Trigger for any Key is checked.   Stack mode What should happen if the state variable changes again while an animation is already playing. Ignore - The currently playing animation will keep playing as if nothing happened. Restart - Restart the currently playing animation. Play Multiple - Play another instance of the animation in addition to the currently running one.

So I found a way to isolate a single application (in my case, spotify) in the same audio output as Aurora.\\nThis makes it so only sound emitted by Spotify is processed and displayed on the keyboard, and does make the visualization change if you change the volume of the music.\\nPrerequisites   Windows 19 build 1809 or above\\n Aurora doesn\\u0026rsquo;t let you pick the audio output device yet. Windows now has a menu where you can force an application to use an output and input device of your choosing.    Virtual Audio Cable\\n We need this so we can listen to 2 output devices at once: The default output every application should emit to, and the virtual audio cable we need for Aurora\\u0026rsquo;s visualizer.    How  Open the Windows Settings app (Win + i).  Click the System button, then select the Sound tab.  Scroll down to the bottom and click \\u0026ldquo;App volume and device preferences\\u0026rdquo;.  Set both Aurora\\u0026rsquo;s and whatever other application you want to be visible\\u0026rsquo;s Output to \\u0026ldquo;CABLE Input\\u0026rdquo;. Then Input option does not need to be changed for this.  Open the legacy Sound settings window. The easiest way is through Control Panel -\\u0026gt; Icons view.  Choose the Recording Tab and double-click \\u0026ldquo;CABLE Output\\u0026rdquo;. Select the Listen Tab. Tick \\u0026ldquo;Listen to this device\\u0026rdquo; and choose your headphones/speakers. You should now be able to listen to music!   (Optional) Install Ear Trumpet from the Windows Store to more easily change the volume of Spotify. This method works best if you leave Spotify\\u0026rsquo;s volume at 100% and adjust using the windows mixer instead. This way, Aurora sees every song at the same volume at all times, producing a more consistent effect. \",\"link\":\"//wibble199.github.io/Aurora-Docs/advanced-topics/visualizer-output/\",\"title\":\"Audio Visualizer Tweaks\"},{\"content\":\"The blinking layer sets the colors of the specified keys to flash between two alternatives, with no fading between the colors.

Maths    Name Description     Absolute Takes another numeric expression and returns the positive equivalent of it. For example, 5 would simply return 5, but -10 would return 10.   Arithmetic Operation Performs a simple binary mathematical operation on the two given numeric expressions. Operators are +, -, x, ÷ and mod. mod returns the remainder when operand 1 is divided by operand 2. For example, 4 mod 3 = 1, 4 mod 2 = 0, etc.   Number Constant Represents a static number that you can set in the UI. This number will not change.   Numeric Map Maps a value that is within one range onto another range. For example, consider we have the number 75 within the range 50 to 100. If we map that onto range 0 to 1, the result will be 0.5. This is because 75 is half way between 50 and 100, so it becomes half way between 0 and 1. It will also accept ranges that are inverse. For example, if we map the value 7 from the range 10 to 0 onto 0 to 100, the result is 30. This is because 7 is 30% of the way from 10 to 0. For the mathematically inclined, the exact equation is this: Note that the output from this is clamped so that it will never go out of the \\\"from\\\" range of the function.   Wave Function Performs a wave function with a period of 1 on the given input. The output will always be between 0 and 1.

This allows for a huge amount of control and customizability with your lighting that layers on their own cannot provide. You can still get fairly customization layers without this system, so do not worry if you don\\u0026rsquo;t understand it. This is a feature mainly for advanced users.\\nThe overrides system works by providing you, the user, the ability to use one of several techniques to override individual properties with custom values. If no override is provided, the value you\\u0026rsquo;ve set on the normal properties editor panel will be used instead. Overrides are done on a per-property basis, so you can use one technique for one property, a different one for another property or no technique for a third for example.\\nThe Editor To open the overrides editor panel, first select the layer whose properties you want to override then click on the left-most button in the top right of the properties panel.\\nThe editor is split into two columns. The left column contains a list of all overridable properties on the selected layer, showing their name and type. Note that not all properties are overridable. The right hand (larger) column is where the main logic editor is. This area is how you choose and edit the override technique. Initially, only a drop down box will be shown with an empty area.\\nTo actually setup an override for a property, select it from the property list, then choose an override mode from the drop down list.\\nOverride Modes Dynamic Value The dynamic value override method allows you to dynamically create a value based on values of other variables.\\nA simple example for this could be assigning to opacity of a layer to be the health of a player, so it appears to fade in as the health lowers, showing a red warning when your character is close to death. A more complex example could be constructing a color based on the current time, with seconds being red, minutes green and hours blue. Whether you\\u0026rsquo;d actually want this who knows, but it\\u0026rsquo;s possible with this override technique.\\nDepending on the type of property being edited, you will be asked to provide one or more expressions of different types. Descriptions of these expressions are available in the \\u0026ldquo;Reference: Expression Types\\u0026rdquo; section of the guide. For example, the \\u0026ldquo;Enabled\\u0026rdquo; property will require a boolean expression and \\u0026ldquo;Opacity\\u0026rdquo; will require a numeric expression.\\nLookup Table The lookup table is a list of condition-value pairs. When using this override technique, Aurora will evaluate the boolean condition expression of each item in the list until it finds one that is true. When it does so, it will override the requested property with the value of the pair.\\nIf you are familiar with the concept of programming, you can think of a lookup table as being like a switch statement or a collection of if else if blocks.\\nDemos This profile contains a single solid fill layer that fades in and out every second, each second alternating between red, green and blue.\\nYou can download the demo profile here.\\n\",\"link\":\"//wibble199.github.io/Aurora-Docs/advanced-topics/overrides-system/\",\"title\":\"Overrides System\"},{\"content\":\"This layer is very similar to the regular particle layer, however instead of constantly spawning particle it does so for each pressed key.

Note that if Enable Scroll is checked, the order of the keys matters.    \",\"link\":\"//wibble199.github.io/Aurora-Docs/reference-layers/toolbar/\",\"title\":\"Toolbar Layer\"},{\"content\":\"Aurora stores all user data in a directory in the roaming application data folder. This user data includes all your settings (such as preferred devices, bitmap accurracy, etc) as well as all your lighting profiles and recent logs that Aurora has created. You can see the Aurora folder by navigating to %APPDATA%\\\\Aurora in Windows file explorer.\\nImporting Profiles Profiles that others have made can be imported easily into Aurora using the import button on the \\u0026ldquo;Profiles\\u0026rdquo; section. Pressing this button will open a dialog asking you to choose a file to import. JSON files that have been exported from Aurora (see exporting profiles) are fully supported through import. In addition, Aurora has partial support for implementing iCUE profiles, however due to the nature of it being a different program with different layers and formats, imported profiles may not look identical.\\nWhen importing a profile, a new profile will appear in the profile list - you do not need to worry about it overwriting the profile you currently have selected. If you wish to merge the imported profile with an existing one you have, you can select the layers from one profile and copy and paste them using the relevant buttons or by pressing the Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V keys on the keyboard.\\nExporting Profiles If you have created a profile that you wish to share with other people, you can easily export it by clicking the export button on the \\u0026ldquo;Profiles\\u0026rdquo; section. Clicking this button will open a window where you will be asked to save the profile as a JSON file. This JSON file can then be sent to other people who can import it into Aurora using the method described above. There is no way to export Aurora profiles into other applications such as LGS or iCUE.\\nTaking a Backup There amy be times when it would be wise to take a backus of your enitre Aurora data folder (for example when you are installing a test build of Aurora). Doing this is a very simple matter of duplicating a folder.\\n First, open up Windows file explorer. In the address bar, type %APPDATA% and press enter. This will take you to the folder where various installed programs can store data for your user account. There will be a folder called \\u0026ldquo;Aurora\\u0026rdquo; in here. Simply copy that folder to a different location (for example your Documents).   Should you need to restore data that\\u0026rsquo;s been backed up in future, you can simply replace the sane Aurora direction with the backup folder.  Clearing User Data Clearling your user data may be required if you start using test versions of Aurora or need to downgrade your Aurora installation for whatever reason. To do this, you can simply delete (or rename/move if you intend to reuse to this data some time) the Aurora folder.\\n First, ensure that you have closed Aurora. Deleting data while Aurora is running may cause it to crash. Additionally, Aurora will write some data to it\\u0026rsquo;s user data folder when it closes. Next, open up Windows file explorer and in the address bar, type %APPDATA% and press enter. This will take you to the roaming application data folder. There will be a folder called \\u0026ldquo;Aurora\\u0026rdquo; in here. Simply delete, move or rename that folder. When you next re-open Aurora, it will recreate all the neccessary data with the default configuration: default settings, default profiles, etc.  \",\"link\":\"//wibble199.github.io/Aurora-Docs/basic-topics/user-data/\",\"title\":\"User Data\"},{\"content\":\"The wrapper layer is a special layer that is able to display lighting received from games that have been patched with the relevant wrapper patch and that have native lighting of some sort.\\nTo patch a game, navigate to \\u0026ldquo;Settings\\u0026rdquo; -\\u0026gt; \\u0026ldquo;Devices \\u0026amp; Wrappers\\u0026rdquo; -\\u0026gt; \\u0026ldquo;Install Wrapper Patch for xxx\\u0026rdquo;, where xxx is the name of the native lighting provided by that game. Do not patch the game with their own device\\u0026rsquo;s brand (unless that is also the provider of the in game lighting). For example, if I am using a Logitech keyboard, and I wish to get the lights from Killing Floor 2, I need to patch using the LightFX wrapper, since Killing Floor uses LightFX library to provide it\\u0026rsquo;s lighting.\\nNote that some more recent and multiplayer titles have been shipping with anti-cheat or signature checking on the lighting DLL file. In these cases, the game will not load our modified wrapper. Unfortunately there's nothing we are able to do about this. Examples of these games include Apex Legends, Fortnite and Division 2.\\nAurora is not able to directly control the affects these games apply, since Aurora is unable to get values from the game (such as health/ammo/etc.). The only data the lighting engine sends is which keys should be which color.\\nKey Cloning The key cloning option of the wrapper layer is useful for if the device you are using has some keys that aren\\u0026rsquo;t handled by the wrapper layer, often this is lights such as macro keys or the perihperal logo.\\nYou can add an item to the source keys list, then clicking it, then adding one or more keys to the destination keys list. The layer will then take whatever value the source key is and apply it to the destination key(s). You can have multiple source keys, each with their own destination keys if you desire.\\n\",\"link\":\"//wibble199.github.io/Aurora-Docs/reference-layers/wrapper/\",\"title\":\"Wrapper Lights Layer\"}]");const lunrIndex=lunr(function(){this.ref('index');this.field('title');this.field('content');this.metadataWhitelist=['position'];index.forEach((page,i)=>this.add({index:i,...page}));});function performSearch(str){if(!str)
