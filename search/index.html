Applications On the far left is the application list, with each application shown as an icon. All the applications and games you will see here by default have some sort of integration or preset profile. You are not limited to just these ones however; by scrolling to the bottom of the list and clicking the plus icon you can create new applications.\\nYou can disable applications if you don’t want your lighting changing when you open that app by right clicking the icon and un-checking the “Enabled” box. You can also right-click on the application icons to hide them if you do not have that game and don’t want it cluttering up the list.\\nAurora works by detecting the application that is currently focused and checking if it has an application entry for that application. If it does, it will render the active profile (we\\u0026rsquo;ll see what a profile is in the next section) to your peripherals. If it does not, it will render the \\u0026ldquo;Desktop\\u0026rdquo; application\\u0026rsquo;s selected profile.\\nProfiles Profiles are a collection of layers that will be drawn to the keyboard whenever that application is currently open (and in the foreground). An application can have one or more profiles, but only one profile can be active at once. You can assign keys to each profile allowing you to switch between them when a specific button is pressed.\\nTo view the profiles for the currently selected application, click on the \\u0026ldquo;Profiles\\u0026rdquo; button in the list view buttons near the top left of the window. The list below this button will then show you all the profiles of the application. From here you can:\\nAdd a new profile by clicking the \\u0026ldquo;Add\\u0026rdquo; button. Delete profiles by clicking the red \\u0026ldquo;X\\u0026rdquo; button. Import a profile from .json file. Export your profile as a .json file. Copy/paste profiles to duplicate them or add them to another application. Reset the profile to the default state. Rename a profile by clicking on it, then typing a name in the \\u0026ldquo;Profile name\\u0026rdquo; box in the properties panel Assign a key to select a profile by clicking on it, then clicking \\u0026ldquo;Assign\\u0026rdquo; next to \\u0026ldquo;Keybind to active profile\\u0026rdquo; in the properties panel then pressing the keys on your keyboard you want. Layers A Layer is an instruction for Aurora to set the color of some specific keys on your keyboard. Each layer has different functionality which is detailed in a later section of this guide. The layers are drawn from bottom-to-top, therefore anything higher up the list will take priority over the colors of anything lower down.\\nTo show the layers list, click the \\u0026ldquo;Layers\\u0026rdquo; list view button that will be at the top left or bottom left of the window (depending on whether the profile list is open or not). A list will appear below this button showing you all your layers. From here you can:\\nAdd new layers by clicking on the \\u0026ldquo;Add\\u0026rdquo; button above the layer list. Select a layer and press the copy and paste buttons (or press Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V) to duplicate it or copy it to another profile. Change the layer properties by clicking on a layer and using the properties panel. Delete the layer by selecting it and clicking the red \\u0026ldquo;X\\u0026rdquo; button. Re-order layers by clicking and dragging the triple horizontal line (burger) button next to the layer. Global Layers Global layers are different from regular layers in that they appear whenever a particular process is running (or in the case of desktop global layers, always). For example, if you create a profile for Spotify and add a audio visualizer as an overlay, the visualizer will always appear whenever Spotify is open, regardless of whether you have it in the foreground or not.\\nNote that the layers and global layers for a profile can be enabled/disabled independently. With the Spotify example, if you disable the regular layers for the profile but keep the global layers, your desktop profile will stay active when Spotify is in the foreground instead of going blank with only the global layers.\\nLayer Properties Each layer will have a set of properties that you can change such as color or the keys it affects. This can be changed in the bottom right panel, the Properties Panel.

To edit this animation, the Animation Editor used. This is a powerful tool, and fairly easy to use once you understand how it works. As with all unfamiliar things however, it may be daunting at first.\\nConcepts and Definitions Before getting into the guide itself, let me define some of the concepts and features that are required to fully understand how the animations work.\\nEach frame, the animation is drawn onto a Canvas which is then sent to your connected peripherals. The canvas is a rectangle with a height and a width, this size of which depend on the position and size of the peripherals. Anything drawn to the canvas will be drawn at a specific point on the canvas, with x=0, y=0 being the coordinate of the top left. An animation is built up of one or more Animation Tracks. Each of these tracks can represent a single shape (e.g. rectangle, filled circle, etc.) Each shape has a number of Properties, depending on what sort of shape they are. For example, a circle has radius, center x, center y, color and width properties. These properties determine how the shape will be rendered to the canvas. Each animation track will have one or more Keyframes which are points on the timeline where you can set the properties of a shape. The keyframes do not have to line up on each track. For example one track may only have one keyframe while another may have ten. Between keyframes, the properties of a shape on a track will interpolate, forming a smooth transition. The Editor With that out of the way, lets move on to the creation of an animation. To open the animation editor, first add an animation layer to your profile. On the layer settings, click on the \\u0026ldquo;Edit Animation\\u0026rdquo; button. When you first open the animation editor you will be presented with a screen that looks like this:\\nThere are 3 main areas to the editor:\\nThe timeline which shows the tracks that currently make up the animation as well as also containing a seek line (the vertical red line) which dictates which how far through the animation the preview is. The preview area which shows a skeleton of your peripheral setup and the various shapes that make up the animation at the given time. The property editor which, when a keypoint is selected, allows for editing the properties of that shape for that keypoint. Creating an Animation First we need to add a track by clicking on the \\u0026ldquo;Add Track\\u0026rdquo; button just above and to the left of the timeline, then choosing the type of shape we wish to add. The manual color track allows you to set individual colors of the keyboard (see Closing Notes), rather than using shapes; the other tracks should be self-explanatory. For the purpose of the tutorial, I will add an (unfilled) circle track.\\nYou should now see a new row has appeared in the timeline. This is the new shape we’ve just created. The left-most grey box shows the name of the track, a delete button and an icon to indicate the type of the track. If you so desire you can double click on the name of the track to change it to something more helpful, though this has no effect on the actual animation itself.\\nNext to the grey box you will see a pair of colored rectangles. These represent a keyframe on the track, the color being indicative of the color of the shape at that keyframe. Clicking this keyframe, we can edit the properties of the circle using the properties in the top right. I\\u0026rsquo;m going to set them to the values in the image below.\\nNext, we\\u0026rsquo;ll need another keyframe to animate to, otherwise we will just have a static image! Double click on the timeline inline with the track to insert a new keyframe at that time. Unfortunately the properties are all reset so we have to enter them again from scratch. Like before though, single left click on the keyframe and set the properties in the properties panel. This time, I will use these settings:\\nYou can add as many other keyframes as you like and even add new tracks with their own keyframes using the steps from above, but I won\\u0026rsquo;t bother.\\nOnce done, you can close the animation editor window. Finally, to ensure the animation plays smoothly, we need to set the Animation Duration property of the Animation Layer to be the length of the animation you just created. If you set a value too small, your animation will appear to be cut off, but too long and you animation will not replay quickly.\\nCongratulations, you\\u0026rsquo;ve made your first animation! :tada:\\n","link":"https://www.project-aurora.com/Docs/advanced-topics/animation-editor/","title":"Animation Editor"},{"content":"The animation layer is another very powerful but very complex and hard-to-use layer. It allows for you to create custom animations using shapes and by creating key-frames in the animation editor. There is a basic guide on how to create animations here.\\nThis layer can also be triggered when certain events happen. You can select it for when a game-state value changes or when you press/release a key. When in a key-mode, the animation can optionally be translated to the location of the pressed key. This basically provides a means of creating a custom interactive layer if you don’t like that layer’s default effects.\\nProperties Name Description Display Only on Key Sequence Keys If this is selected, the animation will only be displayed on the keys in the Affect Keys list. Scale to Key Sequence bounds If this is checked, the animation bitmap will be scaled and translated so that it covers the keys in the Affected Keys list. Affected Keys If Display Only on Key Sequence Keys is checked, the animation will only be displayed on these keys. Animation Duration The length of time an animation takes to play. If you do not set this value high enough, the animation will appear to be cut off as it ends too early. Repeat Times The amount of times the animation will repeat. If set to 0, it will repeat indefinitely. When the trigger is not \\u0026ldquo;Always on\\u0026rdquo;, this should not be set to 0 as once triggered the animation will carry on forever. Trigger This option is how you set when the animations should be played. The sub-properties for each of these trigger modes are detailed in the tabs below. \\u0026ldquo;Always On\\u0026rdquo; does not have any additional properties.

So I found a way to isolate a single application (in my case, Spotify) in the same audio output as Aurora.\\nThis makes it so only sound emitted by Spotify is processed and displayed on the keyboard, and does make the visualization change if you change the volume of the music.\\nPrerequisites Windows 19 build 1809 or above\\nAurora doesn\\u0026rsquo;t let you pick the audio output device yet.

How Open the Windows Settings app (Win + i). Click the System button, then select the Sound tab. Scroll down to the bottom and click \\u0026ldquo;App volume and device preferences\\u0026rdquo;. Set both Aurora\\u0026rsquo;s and whatever other application you want to be visible\\u0026rsquo;s Output to \\u0026ldquo;CABLE Input\\u0026rdquo;.

You should now be able to listen to music! (Optional) Install Ear Trumpet from the Windows Store to more easily change the volume of Spotify. This method works best if you leave Spotify\\u0026rsquo;s volume at 100% and adjust using the windows mixer instead.

This allows for a huge amount of control and customizability with your lighting that layers on their own cannot provide. You can still get fairly customization layers without this system, so do not worry if you don\\u0026rsquo;t understand it. This is a feature mainly for advanced users.\\nThe overrides system works by providing you, the user, the ability to use one of several techniques to override individual properties with custom values. If no override is provided, the value you\\u0026rsquo;ve set on the normal properties editor panel will be used instead. Overrides are done on a per-property basis, so you can use one technique for one property, a different one for another property or no technique for a third for example.\\nThe Editor To open the overrides editor panel, first select the layer whose properties you want to override then click on the left-most button in the top right of the properties panel.\\nThe editor is split into two columns. The left column contains a list of all overridable properties on the selected layer, showing their name and type. Note that not all properties are overridable. The right hand (larger) column is where the main logic editor is. This area is how you choose and edit the override technique. Initially, only a drop down box will be shown with an empty area.\\nTo actually setup an override for a property, select it from the property list, then choose an override mode from the drop down list.\\nOverride Modes Dynamic Value The dynamic value override method allows you to dynamically create a value based on values of other variables.\\nA simple example for this could be assigning to opacity of a layer to be the health of a player, so it appears to fade in as the health lowers, showing a red warning when your character is close to death. A more complex example could be constructing a color based on the current time, with seconds being red, minutes green and hours blue. Whether you\\u0026rsquo;d actually want this who knows, but it\\u0026rsquo;s possible with this override technique.\\nDepending on the type of property being edited, you will be asked to provide one or more expressions of different types. Descriptions of these expressions are available in the \\u0026ldquo;Reference: Expression Types\\u0026rdquo; section of the guide. For example, the \\u0026ldquo;Enabled\\u0026rdquo; property will require a boolean expression and \\u0026ldquo;Opacity\\u0026rdquo; will require a numeric expression.\\nLookup Table The lookup table is a list of condition-value pairs. When using this override technique, Aurora will evaluate the boolean condition expression of each item in the list until it finds one that is true. When it does so, it will override the requested property with the value of the pair.\\nIf you are familiar with the concept of programming, you can think of a lookup table as being like a switch statement or a collection of if else if blocks.\\nDemos This profile contains a single solid fill layer that fades in and out every second, each second alternating between red, green and blue.\\nYou can download the demo profile here.\\n","link":"https://www.project-aurora.com/Docs/advanced-topics/overrides-system/","title":"Overrides System"},{"content":"This layer is very similar to the regular particle layer, however instead of constantly spawning particle it does so for each pressed key.

This value represents the current value of whichever variable you are watching, e.g. health, ammo, etc. Maximum Value The path of a State Variable or a number. This value represents the value that is the maximum value of the percent layer. This will be your max health, or max ammo etc. Progress Color In the case of progressive effect types: the color that the active keys will take. For example, if current was 50 and max was 100, then the first half of the keys will be lit this color. For \\"all at once\\": the color that will be mixed with the background color depending on the current/max ratio. Background Color For progressive effect types: the color that will appear if the key is not being shown in progress color. For \\"all at once\\": the color that will be mixed with the progress color depending on the current/max ratio. Effect Type All at once - All keys in the affected keys sequence share the same color. This color will be given by a blend of progress and background depending on the current/max ratio. For example: if progress is green, background is blue, current is 30 and max is 100: all the keys will be set to a blend of 30% green, 70% blue. Progressive - The keys will light up in progress color when they are active. For example: if there are 10 keys in the affected key list, progress is green, background is blue, current is 30 and max is 100: the first 3 keys will be green, the others blue. Progressive (Gradual) - Same as progressive, but any keys that are partially active will have their color interpolated. Blink Threshold If the current/max percentage is less than this value, the \\"active\\" keys will fade in and out.
